2. **Issue:** **Vostio LS Site-Wide Outage (Network Change)**
    
    - **Context:** Case CS0390552 (Calgary Marriott). The "Chicken and Egg" problem where offline BluFis can't receive the update to tell them how to get online.
        
    - **Why you need it:** Because customers constantly change their Wi-Fi passwords and then act surprised when their IoT devices stop talking. This guide explains the "Rollback" vs. "Manual" fix.
3. **Issue:** **Visionline Client Startup Errors (0x67890048)**
    
    - **Context:** Case CS0398728 & CS0395036. Customers re-imaging computers and breaking the client-server link.
        
    - **Why you need it:** This is the #1 error for "I got a new computer." A quick guide on pointing the client to the server would save you typing it out every time.
        
4. **Issue:** **Legacy Media / "Appropriate Sector" Errors**
    
    - **Context:** Case CS0395512 (Galleon Resort). The customer's cheap Ultralight wristbands stopped working after an upgrade.
        
    - **Why you need it:** To remind you (and them) that this is a Licensing/Option Code fix, not a broken encoder.

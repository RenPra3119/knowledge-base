# GSI.S.H2'Vis.LL.Jumpstart a Lock
[code]
<h3>HOW TO: Jumpstart a Lock (Hard Reset)</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This procedure is specific to legacy <strong>LockLink</strong> units. It does not apply to Lock Service 3G (laptop) or Vostio Service Tool.</p>
<p><em>* LL = LockLink (Service Unit/Tablet)<br>
* LCU = Lock Controller Unit (The brain)</em></p>

<h4>1. Preparation (The "Kill It" Phase)</h4>
<p>The goal is to completely drain the lock's capacitors so it forgets it was ever confused.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the battery case and <strong>remove one battery</strong> (or disconnect the battery pack).</li>
    <li><strong>Drain Residual Power:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Insert and remove a keycard into the lock reader at least <strong>20 times</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> The lights should stop flashing completely. If you skip this, the jumpstart will fail because the lock is still "awake" and confused.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>2. The Setup (The "Prep" Phase)</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Connect your Service Cable/Contact Card to the LockLink unit.</li>
    <li>On the LockLink:
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <strong>Upload</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the specific <strong>Room Number</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click the <strong>Prog</strong> button (Not Data).</li>
            <li><em>The screen will say "Connect to Lock" or "Insert Card".</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h4>3. The Jumpstart (The "Dexterity Check")</h4>
<p>This step requires perfect timing. You are trying to force the lock to boot up directly into "Programming Mode."</p>
<ol>
    <li>Hold the <strong>Battery</strong> in one hand (poised to push it back in).</li>
    <li>Hold the <strong>Contact Card/Service Cable</strong> in the other hand (poised to insert it).</li>
    <li><strong>SIMULTANEOUSLY:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Push the battery back into place (restoring power).</li>
            <li>Insert the Contact Card into the reader.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If it worked:</strong> The LockLink will show a progress bar and say "Uploading."</li>
    <li><strong>If it failed:</strong> The lock will flash green/red or do nothing.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Remove the battery, drain the power (Step 1), and try again. It often takes 3-4 tries to get the timing right.</li>
</ul>

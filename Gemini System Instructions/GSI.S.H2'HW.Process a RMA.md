<h3>HOW TO: Process a RMA</h3>
<p><em>* RMA = Return Material Authorization<br>
* LCU = Lock Controller Unit<br>
* RC = Remote Controller</em></p>

<hr>

<h4><strong>CRITICAL: The Golden Rules of Returns</strong></h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>NO TICKET, NO RETURN:</strong> All products <strong>MUST</strong> undergo troubleshooting with a Support Representative (that's us) before an RMA can be issued.</li>
    <li><strong>NO RMA NUMBER, NO REFUND:</strong> Products sent without a valid RMA number on the label will be <strong>rejected</strong> and returned at the customer's expense.</li>
    <li><strong>YOU BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT:</strong> Improper packaging (e.g., <strong>pinched wires</strong>) counts as physical damage and voids the warranty. The customer will be billed.</li>
</ol>

<h4>1. How to Obtain an RMA Number</h4>
<p>Once troubleshooting confirms the hardware is defective:</p>

<p><strong>Option A: Customer Service Portal (Preferred)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Log in to: <a href="https://my.vingcard.com">https://my.vingcard.com</a></li>
    <li>Create an RMA in the Service Catalog.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option B: Phone Support</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Call <strong>800.225.8464</strong> (Option 2).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>2. Advanced Shipment (Getting a replacement <em>before</em> returning the old one)</h4>
<p>Advanced shipping is discretionary and may require a credit card or PO. It is typically ONLY approved for critical "Front Desk" or "Building Security" items:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Key Encoders</li>
    <li>Service Devices (LockLink/LS3G cables)</li>
    <li>Remote / Elevator Controllers</li>
    <li>Exit Devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the old unit is not returned within <strong>10 business days</strong>, the customer will be billed for the advanced unit.</p>

<hr>

<h4>3. Shipping Instructions & Address</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Freight:</strong> Customer pays shipping to Vingcard. Vingcard pays Ground shipping back (for warranty items).</li>
    <li><strong>Labels:</strong> The RMA Number must be clearly visible on the shipping label.</li>
    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Returns for credit must be received within <strong>10 business days</strong> (35% restocking fee applies).</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Warranty Specifics</h4>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Extended Warranty:</strong> Replaces defective product up to 10 years of age (requires contract).</li>
    <li><strong>3rd Party Hardware (Dell/HP/etc):</strong> These do <strong>NOT</strong> get the 1-year protection. They have a complimentary <strong>90-day warranty</strong> from the ship date.</li>
</ul>

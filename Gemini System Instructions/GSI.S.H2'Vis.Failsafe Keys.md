# GSI.S.H2'Vis.Failsafe Keys
[code]
<h3>HOW TO: Set Up Failsafe Keys (Sequential Method)</h3>
<p><em>* Failsafe/Power Down Key = Emergency Backup Key (Works when system is down)<br>
* Sequential Method = Pre-making specific stacks for specific rooms (The "Envelope Method")<br>
* Programming Card = The Master Key used to "prime" the lock to accept the Failsafe key</em></p>

<h4>1. The Concept: Why Sequential?</h4>
<p>The Sequential method shifts the work from "During the Emergency" to "Right Now."</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> You make the cards and program the locks <em>before</em> the system goes down.</li>
    <li><strong>The Emergency:</strong> You simply hand the pre-made card to the guest. No staff escort or special programming is needed at the time of check-in.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>CRITICAL: Expiration Rules</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Guest Failsafe Keys:</strong> Do NOT expire (until used or canceled by a new standard guest key).</li>
    <li><strong>Programming Card:</strong> Expires in <strong>2 years</strong>. You must remake this card every 2 years to keep the system functional.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>2. Creation: The Programming Card</h4>
<p><em>You need this card to "prime" the locks to accept the guest keys.</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Special Keycards > Fail safe</strong> (or Power Down).</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Programming</strong> tab.</li>
    <li><strong>Override previous keycards?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Select <strong>Yes</strong> if: This is your first card, you lost the old one, or the old one is expiring. (Note: This invalidates old Programming cards).</li>
            <li>Select <strong>No</strong> if: You just want a duplicate copy for a second staff member.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Encode</strong> and insert a blank card.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h4>3. Creation: The Guest Stacks (The Envelopes)</h4>
<p><em>Repeat this process for every room in the hotel.</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <strong>Fail-safe</strong> tab (next to the Programming tab).</li>
    <li><strong>No. of keycards in stack:</strong> Enter a number (e.g., <strong>3</strong>).
        <ul><li><em>This is how many separate check-ins you can handle per room during an outage.</em></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Copies pr. Keycard:</strong> Enter a number (e.g., <strong>2</strong>).
        <ul><li><em>This is how many keys you give to each guest party (e.g., for roommates).</em></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Group:</strong> Select a generic group like "Guest" or "Fail Safe".</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Encode</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>CRITICAL: Organization is Key</strong></h4>
<p>As you encode, the system will prompt you: <em>"Card #1 Copy #1"</em>, <em>"Card #1 Copy #2"</em>, etc.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step A:</strong> Group the copies together with a rubber band (e.g., Card 1 Copy 1 & 2).</li>
    <li><strong>Step B:</strong> Place the entire stack for that room into an envelope.</li>
    <li><strong>Step C:</strong> Do <strong>NOT</strong> write the room number on the envelope yet. The cards are generic until they touch the lock.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>4. Deployment: Assigning the Rooms (The Walk)</h4>
<p><em>You must physically visit every door to assign the stacks.</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Take your <strong>Programming Card</strong> and your <strong>Envelopes</strong> of keys to the rooms.</li>
    <li>Go to the first room (e.g., 101).</li>
    <li>Insert/Tap the <strong>Fail-Safe Programming Card</strong>.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Result:</em> The lock may flash green or show no reaction. It is now in "Listening Mode."</li>
            <li><em>Error:</em> If it flashes RED immediately, the Programming Card is invalid.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Immediately Insert/Tap <strong>ONE</strong> guest key from your stack.
        <ul>
            <li><em>Result:</em> The lock should flash <strong>GREEN</strong>.</li>
            <li><em>Note:</em> The door usually does <em>not</em> unlock at this moment; it just accepts the programming. This action assigns that entire stack to Room 101.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write "Room 101" on the envelope and place the keys back inside.</li>
    <li>Repeat for every room.</li>
</ol>

<h4>5. Storage and Restoration</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Keep the labeled envelopes in a secure "Crash Box" at the Front Desk. Keep the Programming Card in the safe.</li>
    <li><strong>In an Emergency:</strong> Grab the envelope for the room, hand the guest the keys from "Stack #1".</li>
    <li><strong>Restoring Normalcy:</strong> Once the system is back online, issuing a standard New Guest Key for the room will automatically cancel the Failsafe key.</li>
</ul>
